# REST API for Post Creation, Update, and Deletion (Quora-like) üöÄ

Welcome to my **REST API** project for practicing CRUD operations on posts! This API allows you to manage posts, similar to how a platform like Quora lets users create, update, and delete posts.

This project is a simple demonstration of handling posts via an API using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It stores posts in-memory (using arrays) for quick learning and prototyping.

### üåê **Overview**
This repository provides a REST API that enables users to create, update, and delete posts, with each post having a title and content. The posts are temporarily stored in an array (for learning purposes) and can be managed through the following HTTP methods:

- **POST**: Create a new post.
- **GET**: Retrieve all posts or a specific post.
- **PUT**: Update an existing post.
- **DELETE**: Delete a post.

### üìÇ **Features in this API:**
- **Create a post**: Allows users to create a post with a title and content.
- **View all posts**: Fetch all posts in the database.
- **Update a post**: Modify the title or content of a specific post.
- **Delete a post**: Remove a post from the database.
  
### üõ† **Technologies Used:**
- **Node.js** (Backend runtime environment)
- **Express.js** (Web framework for handling HTTP requests)
- **In-memory data storage** (Array for storing posts)
